Hansel And Gretel
=================

Android library providing bread crumbs for compatibility fragments.

Forked version with some custom modification:
 - remove need to call setActivity() method
 - add new setLastTitle() method which allow add custom crumbs at the end


Usage
=====

*For a working implementation of this project see the `sample/` folder.*

 1. Include the widget in your view. This should usually be placed directly
    above the container in which the associated fragments will be displayed.

        <android.support.v4.app.FragmentBreadCrumbs
            android:id="@+id/breadcrumbs"
            android:layout_width="fill_parent"
            android:layout_height="40dp" />

 2. Add the required style attributes to your theme.

        <item name="hagDividerVertical">@drawable/hag__divider_dark</item>
        <item name="hagSelectableItemBackground">@drawable/hag__background_dark</item>

    or

        <item name="hagDividerVertical">@drawable/hag__divider_dark</item>
        <item name="hagSelectableItemBackground">@drawable/hag__background_dark</item>

    or specify your own drawables for the divider and background.

 3. *(Optional)* Set the title of the initial view. This can be useful when the
    initial activity view has a default fragment.

        //continued from above
        FragmentBreadCrumbs crumbs = (FragmentBreadCrumbs)findViewById(R.id.breadcrumbs);
        crumbs.setTitle("Settings", null);
